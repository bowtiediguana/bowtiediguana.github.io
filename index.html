      <h2>How Anyone* Can Make Money As A Cartoon (*Talent Required)</h2>
      <p>After a decade long career in software, which included roles building tech for traders and information
        security, Iguana got into crypto.</p>
      <p>As a cartoon lizard he helps decentralized finance projects and protocols secure their infrastructure against
        hackers, writes a top crypto newsletter for over 25,000 subscribers with a <a
          href="https://twitter.com/BowTiedNightOwl">cartoon owl</a>, and is currently building the safest laptop for
        business owners, crypto users, and other high value targets.</p>
      <p>Iguana is enthusastic about helping others through well paid remote work and entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p>Iguana and Owl created the premier course to learn the fundamentals to find work in decentralized finance, and
        we also actively search for and fund talent (for free!) through the BowTied "Jungle" Twitter community founded
        by <a href="https://twitter.com/BowTiedBull">@BowTiedBull</a></p>
